Description: provides mass spectrometry data and solutions for deriving the
  proteins of interest. 
  The peptides are engineered to contain only a subset of amino acids of the
  pre-defined composition. Individual peptides should differ from each other
  in mass, sequence, and hydrophobicity, so those large mixtures of such peptide
  can be efficiently separated by reversed phase 
  chromatography and unambiguously detected by mass spectrometry due to their
  mass and sequence.
  The data were acquired at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich.
