Description: provides data and solutions for deriving to proteins of interest. 
  The peptides are engineered to contain only a subset of amino acids of the pre-defined composition. 
  Individual peptides should differ from each other in mass, sequence, and hydrophobicity, 
  so those large mixtures of such peptide can be efficiently separated by reversed phase 
  chromatography and unambiguously detected by mass spectrometry due to their mass and sequence.
  The data were acquired at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich.
