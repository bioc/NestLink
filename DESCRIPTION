Description: Provides next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry
  (MS) sample data, code snippets and replication material used for developing
  NestLink. The NestLink approach is a protein binder selection and
  identification technology able to biophysically characterize thousands of
  library members at once without handling individual clones at any stage of the
  process. Data were mainly acquired on the NGS and MS platforms at the
  Functional Genomics Center Zurich core facility.
